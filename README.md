## Goal, powerups, controls

The rocket follows your mouse cursor. The main goal is to get the highest score by going as far as possible. The further you are, the higher the speed is (of your ship and also the rotation of the obstacles). The game ends if you hit an obstacle.

You can help yourself last longer by picking up the two main powerups: *shield power* and *brake power*. Shields (left click, hold) allow you to pass through obstacles without dying, whereas the brake allows you to slow down (right click, hold).

The third bonus is just _score boost_. It's *shiny*.
